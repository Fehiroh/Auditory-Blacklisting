## About

During COVID-19, job prospects are scarce, financial stress can be high, and it can be easy to find oneself trapped in a loop of obsessively checking job board sites to see if anything new has come up. This is what happened to a friend of mine, who joked that she wished someone would stand behiond her and make an annoying sound everytime she went on linkedin. 15 minutes later, and I had a very simple prototype made. She has probably learned to be careful what she wishes for.
